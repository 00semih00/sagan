How to complete this guide
--------------------------

Like all Spring's [Getting Started guides](/getting-started), you can choose to start from scratch and complete each step, or you can jump past basic setup steps that may already be familiar to you. Either way, you'll end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, just move on to the next section and start [setting up the project](#scratch).

If you'd like to **skip the basics**, then do the following:

 - [download][zip] and unzip the source repository for this guideâ€”or clone it using [git](/understanding/git):
`git clone https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-rest-service.git`
 - cd into `gs-rest-service/initial`
 - jump ahead to [create a resource representation class](#initial).

And **when you're finished**, you can check your results against the the code in `gs-rest-service/complete`.

There's more to building RESTful web services than is covered here. You may want to continue your exploration of Spring and REST with the following Getting Started guides:

* [Handling POST, PUT, and GET requests in REST services](TODO)
* [Creating self-describing APIs with HATEOAS](TODO)
* [Securing a REST service with HTTP Basic](TODO)
* [Securing a REST service with OAuth](TODO)
* [Consuming REST services](https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-consuming-rest-core/blob/master/README.md)
* [Testing REST services](TODO)

# [build-system-intro]

First you'll need to set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but we've included what you'll need to work with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org) here. If you're not familiar with either of these, you can refer to our [Getting Started with Maven](../gs-maven/README.md) or [Getting Started with Gradle](../gs-gradle/README.md) guides.



# [bootstrap-starter-pom-disclaimer]

TODO: mention that we're using Spring Bootstrap's [_starter POMs_](../gs-bootstrap-starter) here.

Experienced Maven users who feel nervous about using an external parent project: don't panic, you can take it out later, it's just there to reduce the amount of code you have to write to get started.
